Requirements:
create StopWatch class,
include a constructor to start the clock
Start method to restart the clock,
Stop method to record the end time for an event.
Include two different methods to report the time in seconds and milliseconds as doubles
use chrono header from STL to get time from system.

use this to test search, binary_search, and two othe ralgorithms in STLa
measure time for each algorithm at least 5 times in ranges:
10,100,1K,10K, 100K, 1M, 10M, 100M, 1B
